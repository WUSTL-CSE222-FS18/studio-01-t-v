# Studio 1

As with Studio 0, insert your answers to the questions in this document where indicated (and in the format requested).

# Part 0: Class policies

You should review all the class policies and post any questions or clarifications via Piazza (as a followup to the Welcome message) by Wednesday, Sept. 5.

***Q1.0 Please acknowledge that you will review the class policies and, if necessary, ask for any clarifications by Wed, Sept. 5.  Each person should type their name below to acknowledge this request:***

Vishesh Patel and Tee Li

# Part 1: Choose your own IoT Adventure

These will be timed activities.  Please note the timer and be sure to use your time wisely.

## Part 1.1: Picking a Mission (7 minutes)

Your group will be both a "Customer" and a "Designer".  First you'll prepare for your Customer role.  Browse through the "Mission" cards and select the one that interests you. You may use either the specific example on the card or be creative and try to develop another example that fits the goal given on the card. Any discussions with  Designers should not reveal the specific example you have in mind.  Try to really think about the example and how it would fit into your life as a customer. Try to build an entire story around it.  Make sure you have a clear vision in mind.

***Q1.1 Briefly describe your Mission:***


According to a recent report by California's public health office, prolonged cellphone radiation is an issue that can cause serious health problems over time, but is one that most people are not aware of. We consider a device that can track forms of radiation (like cellphone radiation) that are common and may be harmful to users if they are constantly exposed to it. The idea would be to make it so that people are more aware of prolonged but menial radiation exposure that affects them on a daily basis, as too much radiation of any kind can lead to types of cancers or other diseases.

## Part 1.2: Finding a Designer/Customer (3 minutes)

Find another group to work with. The other group should be students who neither of you have worked with before and far enough away that they didn't overhear any of your discussion of your Mission. One group will be "Designers" while another is "Customers".  Then the groups will switch roles (so each will be a Designer while the other is a Customer).  Pick which group is "Designing" first.

## Part 1.3 Empathizing (13 minutes total)

(7 minutes) The Designer's first step in design thinking is empathizing with the person who the design is for.  The Designer should have a conversation with the Customer to get to know them and to ask about the Customer's needs and interests.  The goal is to try to identify the customer's need, *not a specific solution*.  The Designers who are going first should interview the customer and try to figure out the underlying need they'd like to satisfy.  

***Q1.2 Share some notes from your interview here and try to describe the "need" with a very brief description:***

Saving time: Making tasks easier, not thinking about smaller tasks people do on a daily basis. "I'm busy and forgetful".

A device/app that can let users configure their laundry machines on the go in terms of washing/drying settings, provide real time status of soap/detergent and send notifications depending on remaining quantity, and also notifications upon completion of cycles. Should also let users stop or pause cycles midway through from a remote location.

(6 minutes) Reverse roles. The Customers are now Designers and vice versa.  Repeat the interview process. (Designers, complete the question above in that space)

## Part 1.4: Proposing solutions (8 minutes)

Return to your original locations.  In this step all groups will act like Designers.  Another vital aspect of design thinking is open-minded brainstorming about potential solutions that will fulfill the Customer's needs.   Review your notes about the Customer's needs.  Use cards from the Things, Services, Human Actions, and Feedback decks to *design two (2) or more different solutions* to the Customer's needs.

***Q1.3 Briefly describe your solutions (use a list) and any strengths/weaknesses you see.***

1. smart washing machines
  * Strengths
    * configurable
    * connected
    * user-friendly (simple)  
    * commonplace/widespread
  * Weaknesses
    * hackable
    * cost? (need to purchase washing machine)
    * relies on wifi

1. app
  * Strengths
    * usable
    * easy access
    * friendly UI, responsive
  * Weaknesses
    * storage space
    * background usage (data? battery?)
    * relies on compatible phone

## Part 1.5: Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers:  Present your solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  As a Designer you should be open to any initial reactions.  Customers: think carefully about your original "need" and try to give both pros and cons of the proposed solutions.

***Q1.4 Designers: Briefly summarize their feedback for each solution:***

Washing machine feedback:
They like it.
They want it to order detergent instead of doing it themselves.

App:
Want the app to provide notifications when detergent is low and also a link or something of the like for the user to purchase more detergent.


(4 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 1.6: Iteration (6 minutes)

Return to your original seats.

In this phase everyone is thinking like a Designer.  Design thinking also relies on iterative refinement of work to suite the Customer.  Are there ways it could be improved?  Discuss the feedback and refine/update your work if needed.

***Q1.5 Based on the feedback, how might you change your solution?***

Add a purchase functionality for the user to instantly be able to buy detergent or other necessities for the operation of the machine at the point that the machine detects it is low on that item/substance.

## Part 1.7 Evaluation (5 minutes)

Switch back to being a Customer and thinking about the product you want and the need it should meet.  Pick three (3) Criteria cards that are most important to you and order them from most important to least important.

***Q1.6 List your three top Criteria:***

1. Innovative
1. Utility
1. User Friendly

## Part 1.8: More Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers: Present your revised, final solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  Customers: Evaluate the proposed solution based on the Criteria you selected.

***Q1.7 Briefly summarize your findings as a Designer.  Is the customer happy with your work?  How could it be further improved?***

They are happy with our work. They appreciate being able to order detergent easily.

***Q1.8 Briefly summarize your findings as a Customer.  Will the proposed solution meet your needs?  Was it substantially different than what you may have initially envisioned?***

Phone case is smarter, detects and responds to radiation by killing apps (if given permissions) and doing other things. The device does meet our needs, though it may not be entirely feasible to have all of the operations happen from the phone case.

(5 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers and Customers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 2: Summary

### Review

Part of the goal of today's studio was to provide you some "menus" for:
   - common ingredients in IoT systems,   
   - scenarios where IoT may be of value, and
   - some criteria that can be used to evaluate the value of IoT systems.

***Q2.1 Without reviewing the cards, provide three examples of each type of card along with a brief description (try your best).  Add your answers as a sub-list for each type here:***
- Criteria
  * utility
  * sustainability
  * feasibility
- Things
  * eyewear
  * cameras
  * clothing
- Services
  * facebook
  * twitters
  * instagram
- Feedback
  * text
  * emoji
  * sound
- Human Actions
  * tap
  * tilt
  * lift
- Missions
  * superpowers
  * telepathy
  * timesaver

### Contrast

***Q2.2 In Studio 0 you were supposed to evaluate three examples of IoT. In many cases the examples may not be able to be represented using the cards.  Provide some examples of cards that you think should be added to the deck, either based on the examples from Studio 0, or from this Studio, or based on your own interests.  Be sure to specify the suit (Mission, Thing, Services, Human Interactions, Feedback, and Criteria) as well as a brief description:***

Actually, no. Based on our experience in this studio and the one prior, the cards not only encapsulate all of the criteria and features of the ideas we had, but actually heavily exceed them.
